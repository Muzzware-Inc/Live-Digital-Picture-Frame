# Live-Picture-Frame-Using-Raspberry-PI

![Review](/images/main.jpg)

The goal of this project would be to create a **low
cost** Raspberry Pi Media Panel--a nice looking screen that could stand in the living room,Bedroom or attach to the wall or refrigerator with the primary purpose of streaming personal photo and video content full time,but also be able to do some other cool things when needed...like show the weather, play a movie, play music, or receive AirPlay content.

## Our success criteria would include:smiley::

-Low cost: a full blown computing device and screen for under $100:sneezing_face:

-Attractive: meaning it should be aesthetically acceptable for the living room:smirk:

-Light: no more than a few pounds

-Thin: no more than an inch thick, including frame

-Quick: can be built in a few hours or less:thinking:

-Simple: requiring mainly assembly, versus construction or manufacturing
